yadt (yet another docs tool)
Simple small customizable docs platform that is seo optimized and does not require a build step. Simply add new pages to `pages/` with the following format:

If you want your pages to be in the root directory simply add them to `pages/`. If you want to add your pages under one level folder add it to `pages/{folder-name}/{page-name}`.

All folder and page names should follow the following standard. (support for only .md files)
- lowercase
- words should be seperated by -
- try to avoid special characters

Please look at the current `pages/` for an example structure.
